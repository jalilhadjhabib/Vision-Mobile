# Vision Mobile - Full Stack Developer (https://vision-group-mobile.com/)

This GitHub repository presents my inaugural project as a Full Stack Developer at Biteye Group, developed during my tenure with the company. It features the Vision Mobile app, a comprehensive and secure web application compatible with various devices. The app is intricately integrated with Biteye's Vision Workspace software, primarily designed to efficiently manage and respond to demand requests within the workspace ecosystem.

## Project Context

This necessity was particularly evident in managing and responding to internal demand requests, which required a streamlined and accessible approach. The Vision Mobile app was conceptualized to fulfill this gap, offering a versatile and user-friendly platform accessible from various devices. The project's primary objective was to enhance operational efficiency and ensure seamless integration with the existing Vision Workspace infrastructure, thereby improving overall workflow management and responsiveness within the company.
